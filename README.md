# Hotel Booking Analysis

This is a data analysis project that explores and visualizes hotel booking data to understand cancellation patterns and booking behaviors. This is my very first data analysis project, created entirely using Microsoft Excel.

## Files

  Contains:
  - `hotel_booking` – Cleaned dataset
  - `Pivot` – Pivot tables used for dashboard
  - `Dashboard` – Visualized summary of key insights
